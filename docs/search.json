Trope, is likely male but this has not been included because of the lack of a source.\n\n\n\nDecades\nCompared to Phase 1, the alumni in the list have bcome more recent. Graduates from the ’80s are now far greater than those from the ’70s, and graduates from the last two decades now outnumber thos from the ’50s and ’60s.\n\n\n\nIn Phase 1, women made up less thn 30% of graduates in the ’70s and ’80s. Women now slightly outnumber men in the ’80s and are slightly fewer than men in the ’70s.\n\n\n\nRaces\nAmong all the entries, whites are the greatest, forming a plurality slightly over 30%. Blacks and Hispanics are the most represented minorities, forming slightly more and less than 25% respectively.\nCompared to all the entries in Phase 1, the biggest change is that blacks are no longer near the majority. Also, Asians and not Hispanics were the second most represented minority, though the percentage of Asians has not changed by much between both phases.\nCompared to only those entries from the Micro Museum list, there are more minorities in these entires.\n\n\n\nAmong all races, except Jews and Hispanics, women outnumber men. The opposite was generally true in the Phase 1. The disparity between men and women is greatest among whites.\n\n\n\nCountries\nIn the Airtable, multiple countries may be listed for one entry. These include places where people are involved or born, from what I gathered from a quick reading of one source, usually Wikipedia. These countries are generally in order of precedence. The first, and so primary, country for each entry is used here.\nAn even greater majority of entries are based in the U.S in this phase. Asian countries remain the most of those outside the U.S. With the exception of Australia, there is at least one entry based in every continent.\n\n\n\nParties\nIf a person has more than one party, each is counted here. For the most part, I listed parties for those who had one displayed on Wikipedia, i.e. primarily elected officials.\nThe number of party members increased less than proportionally to the total number of entries, growing from 40 to 51, which may be due in part to the fact that I did not use Wikipedia as a source for all these entries. Democrats from a greater majority than they do last time. Several of the parties listed below are for foreign countries.\n\n\n# A tibble: 51 x 8\n   name    degree   year   category       race    gender party country\n   <chr>   <chr>    <chr>  <chr>          <chr>   <chr>  <chr> <chr>  \n 1 Casper… LL.B.    1966   Corporate / B… White   Male   R     USA    \n 2 Kuehl,… J.D.     1978   Government     White   Female D     USA    \n 3 Estric… J.D.     1977   Government,La… White   Female D     USA    \n 4 Obama,… J.D.     1991   Government     Black … Male   D     USA    \n 5 Obama,… J.D.     1988   Government     Black   Female D     USA    \n 6 Sewell… J.D.     1992   Government     Black   Female D     USA    \n 7 Robins… LL.M.    1968   Government     White   Female Inde… Ireland\n 8 Nader,… LL.B.    1958   Government,Ac… White … Male   Gree… USA    \n 9 Hauser… attende… 1955-… Public Intere… White … Female R     USA    \n10 Lynch,… J.D.     1984   Government,Co… Black   Male   D     USA    \n# … with 41 more rows\n\nMen are the majority of politicians. Men now form a slightly greater majority among Democrats than in Phase 1.\n\n\n\nMinorities now make up the majority of Democrats among the entries.\n\n\n\nRoles\nWe made changes to how we defined roles in this Phase. We replaced the Politics category with Government, with includes both elected politicians and unelected officials, e.g. cabinent members. The category also includes members of organizations such as the U.N., though such also recieve the new role “International”. The category still excludes judges, who remain in a separate “Judiciary” category.\n“Public Interest Law” was rennamed to “Public Interest / Nonprofit Legal Services” and now includes those who practice law for the public interest and members of think tanks and other NGOS.\nAuthors, musicians,journalists, and commentators have all been included into one new role, “Arts / Media / Entertainment.” Media executives also recieve this role, in addition to “Corporate/Business.”\nAmong all the entries, government is the most frequently occuring role, slightly over 30% of all roles. Corporate/Business is now as popular a role as Judges, a big increase in the former and decrease in the latter compared to Phase 1. Law Firm and Academia/Education remain smaller, but have increased more or less proportionally.\n\n\n\nIn most roles women outnumber men, most so in Academia / Education and International. Among Law Firm, Judiciary, and Activist, men are slightly more or as many. Philanthropist is a small category which includes only men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\nGender\n89 entries are Male, 52 are Female, and 1, Jack F. Trope, is likely male but this has not been included because of the lack of a source.\n\n\n\nDecades\nAs expected, the vast majority of entries are from recent decades. The ’70s and ’80s have the most degrees. The ’50s and ’60s are comparatively lacking. It may be natural that the most recent graduates are also lacking.\n\n\n\nAs expected, gender balance becomes more equal in later decades. It is notable, however, that females significantly outnumber males among most recent graduates.\n\n\n\nRaces\nAmong all the entries, blacks outnumber other races. Among only the Micro Museum list, whites are the the greatest in number, forming about 40%.\n\n\n\nAmong all races, males outnumber females. The only exceptions are the races represented by a single member, American Indians and Australian Aboriginals.\n\n\n\nCountries\nIn the Airtable, multiple countries may be listed for one entry. These include places where people are involved or born, from what I gathered from a quick reading of one source, usually Wikipedia. These countries are generally in order of precedence. The first, and so primary, country for each entry is used here.\nAs expected, the vast majority of entries are based in the U.S. Asian countries make up the the majority of foreign locations.\n\n\n\nParties\n40 entries have at least one party. If a person has more than one party, each is counted here. For the most part, I listed parties for those who had one displayed on Wikipedia, i.e. primarily elected officials.\nDemocrats are the most represented party. Several of the parties listed below are for foreign countries.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are nearly equal in gender. Compared to the gender ratio among all the entries, women are overrepresented among Democrats and underrepresented among Republicans.\n\n\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have comparable percentages of racial minorties, though the particular minorities differ.\n\n\n\nRoles\nThe roles now are very rough. They have been gathered from a quick reading of one source, usually Wikipedia. There are several grey areas: the intersection of Politics, Public Interest Law, and Activist; most lawyers have at least some experience in a firm, but they do not now all have the “Law Firm” role.\nAmong all the entries, judges outnumber other roles. Among only the Micro Museum list, “politicians” are the the greatest in number. The “Business” and “Law Firm” roles are comparatively lacking.\n\n\n\nSeveral roles are around 60% male, which is the proportion of males among all the entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegrees\nAs expected, the majority of degrees earned are J.Ds.\n\n\n\nThere is some but not much overlap between when LL.Bs and J.Ds are earned. No LL.Bs are earned after the ’60s and a few J.Ds are held by those who graduated even as early as the ’40s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
