      "contents": "\n\n\n\nGender\n89 entries are Male, 52 are Female, and 1, Jack F. Trope, is likely male but this has not been included because of the lack of a source.\n\n\n\nDecades\nAs expected, the vast majority of entries are from recent decades. The ’70s and 80’s have the most degrees. The ’50s and ’60s are comparatively lacking. It may be natural that the most recent graduates are also lacking.\n\n\n\nAs expected, gender balance becomes more equal in later decades. It is notable, however, that females significantly outnumber males among most recent graduates.\n\n\n\nRaces\nAmong all the entries, blacks outnumber other races. Among only the Micro Museum list, whites are the the greatest in number, forming about 40%.\n\n\n\nAmong all races, males outnumber females. The only exceptions are the for those races represented by a single member, American Indians and Australian Aboriginals.\n\n\n\nCountries\nIn the Airtable, multiple countries may be listed for one entry. These include places where people are involved or born from what I gathered from a quick reading of one source, usually Wikipedia. These countries are generally in order of precedence. The first, and so primary, country is used for each entry here.\nAs expected, the vast majority of entries are based in the U.S. Asian countries make up the the majority of foreign locations.\n\n\n\nParties\n40 entries have a party. For the most part, I listed parties for those who had one displayed on Wikipedia, i.e. primarily elected officials.\nDemocrats are the most represented party. Several of the parties listed below are for foreign countries.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are nearly equal in gender. Compared to the gender ratio among all the entries, women are overrepresented among the Democrats and underrepresented among the Republicans.\n\n\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have comparable percentages of racial minorties, though the particular minorities differ.\n\n\n\nRoles\nThe roles now are very rough. They have been gathered from a quick reading of one source, usually Wikipedia. There are several grey areas: the intersection of Politics, Public Interest Law, and Activist; most lawyers have at least some experience in a firm, but they do not now all have the “Law Firm” role.\nAmong all the entries, judges outnumber other roles. Among only the Micro Museum list, “politicians” are the the greatest in number. The “Business” and “Law Firm” roles are comparatively lacking.\n\n\n\nSeveral roles are around 60% male, which is the proportion of males among all the entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegrees\nAs expected, the majority of degrees earned are J.Ds.\n\n\n\nThere is some but not much overlap between when LL.Bs and J.Ds are earned. No LL.Bs are earned after the ’60s and a few J.Ds are held by those who graduated even as early as the ’40s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
